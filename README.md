# cat-breed-application
A simple express server application that returns the top 5 cat breeds that are child friendly, stranger friendly and dog friendly

** Please install node.js by downloading from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ **

* Open the solution1.js file with code editor
* Go to command line, root to project folder(where you saved in your system ex: C:\Cat-breeds, use the command cd to do the same)
* Once you are in project folder run 'node solution.js', when you see server started message, go to browser type http://localhost:3000/ -> enter. You can see the output
* Alternatively, you can do the same for solution2.js

Ranking was given by adding 3 parameters rating which can be maximum 15
There is 1 cat which scored 15 and 17 cats Which scored 14
solution1.js provided top 5. Top 1 is which scored 15/15 and followed by First 4 casts in alphabetical order which scored 14

I believe Solution2.js is more appropriate if rankings are based on the score each cat scored. And I ranked cats which scored 15 as top 1 and 14 as top 2 and goes till top 5 that scored 11.
